## Description

This project [Paytm Home Page]() was built using Semantic HTML and **Tailwind** from scratch. The official **Paytm** homepage have an issue in responsive design so I made a clone of the Paytm home page using Tailwind and fixed it. It took me close to 16 hours to make Paytm Home page clone. **Tailwind** is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in the markup. This project helped me a lot in understanding the basic yet effective Tailwind concepts. We just have to add our desired Css property in-form of classes and boom we got all the styling covered. The main learning after building this project is to make complex responsive design simpler and easier and faster with **Tailwindcss** screen breakpoints. The Project was completed under guidance of [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), CTO Ineuron
